# Backend Development Interview Notes

## 1. Core Concepts

### Backend Development
Backend development focuses on server-side logic, databases, APIs, and application architecture. It involves handling data storage, processing, and ensuring that the frontend (client-side) has the necessary data to function.

### Client-Server Model
The client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. Clients make requests to servers, which process these requests and return the appropriate responses.

### RESTful APIs
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- the HTTP protocol is almost always used.

- **HTTP Methods**: GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update data), DELETE (remove data).
- **Status Codes**: 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error).
- **Best Practices**: Use nouns for resources, version your APIs, handle errors gracefully.

### GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries by using a type system you define for your data. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

## 2. Programming Languages

### Java
Java is a widely-used programming language for building enterprise-scale applications. It is known for its portability across platforms (thanks to the JVM) and its robust ecosystem.

- **Spring Boot**: A popular framework for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

### Python
Python is known for its simplicity and readability, making it a popular choice for backend development.

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python, which is lightweight and easy to use.

### JavaScript (Node.js)
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It is known for its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.

- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

### Ruby
Ruby is a dynamic, open-source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.

- **Ruby on Rails**: A server-side web application framework written in Ruby. It includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications.

### Go
Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity and performance. It is particularly well-suited for concurrent programming.

- **MongoDB**: A document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format.
- **Cassandra**: A distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers.
- **Redis**: An in-memory key-value store, often used as a cache.

### Database Design

- **Indexing Strategies**: Choosing the right indexes to optimize query performance.

## 4. API Design and Development

### RESTful APIs
- **Resource Naming**: Use nouns to represent resources (e.g., `/users`, `/posts`).
- **HTTP Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
- **Status Codes**: 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 400 (Bad Request), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error).
- **Versioning**: Use versioning in your API to manage changes (e.g., `/v1/users`).

### Authentication and Authorization
- **OAuth2**: A framework for authorization, often used for token-based authentication.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

### Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is used to control the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network. It helps prevent abuse and ensures fair usage.

# Node.js and Express Backend Notes

## 1. **Node.js Overview**
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it lightweight and efficient.

### Key Features:
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses events to handle asynchronous operations.
- **Non-Blocking I/O**: Allows handling multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the execution thread.
- **Single-Threaded**: Uses a single-threaded event loop model for handling requests.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: A vast ecosystem of libraries and tools.

### Use Cases:
- Real-time applications (e.g., chat apps, gaming servers).
- APIs and microservices.
- Data streaming applications.
- Server-side rendering for SPAs (Single Page Applications).

---

## 2. **Express.js Overview**
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It simplifies routing, middleware integration, and request handling.

### Key Features:
- **Routing**: Define endpoints and handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Middleware**: Functions that have access to the request (`req`), response (`res`), and the next middleware in the cycle.
- **Template Engines**: Support for rendering dynamic HTML using engines like EJS, Pug, and Handlebars.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware.

---

## 3. **Core Concepts in Node.js**

### Event Loop
- The event loop is the core of Node.js's non-blocking I/O model.
- It continuously checks for pending events (e.g., I/O operations, timers) and executes their associated callbacks.

### Modules
- Node.js uses the CommonJS module system.
- Use `require()` to import modules and `module.exports` to export them.

```javascript
// Importing a module
const fs = require('fs');

// Exporting a module
module.exports = {
  myFunction: () => console.log('Hello World')
};
```

### Global Objects
- __dirname: The directory name of the current module.

- __filename: The file name of the current module.

- process: Provides information about the current Node.js process.

- Buffer: Handles binary data directly.

### Streams
- Streams are used to handle reading/writing files, network communications, or any end-to-end information exchange efficiently.

- Types: Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform streams.

```
const fs = require('fs');
const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('file.txt');
readableStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  console.log(chunk.toString());
});
```
## 4. Core Concepts in Express.js

 **Routing **
- Define routes for different HTTP methods and URLs.

Example:

```javascript **JavaScript**
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.post('/submit', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Form submitted!');
});
```
### Middleware
- Middleware functions are executed in the order they are added.

- They can modify req and res objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware.
```javascript
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware
});

```
## 7. Example: Building a RESTful API with Express 
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

// In-memory data store
let users = [];

// GET all users
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json(users);
});

// GET a single user by ID
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const user = users.find(u => u.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
  if (!user) return res.status(404).send('User not found');
  res.json(user);
});

// POST a new user
app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  const user = { id: users.length + 1, name: req.body.name };
  users.push(user);
  res.status(201).json(user);
});

// PUT update a user
app.put('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const user = users.find(u => u.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
  if (!user) return res.status(404).send('User not found');
  user.name = req.body.name;
  res.json(user);
});

// DELETE a user
app.delete('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userIndex = users.findIndex(u => u.id === parseInt(req.params.id));
  if (userIndex === -1) return res.status(404).send('User not found');
  users.splice(userIndex, 1);
  res.status(204).send();
});

// Error handling middleware
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```
