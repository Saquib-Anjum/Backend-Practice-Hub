---
Hereâ€™s a list of 50 additional backend interview questions to test your knowledge of advanced backend concepts, system design, and real-world scenarios.

**System Design Questions**
---------------------------

### **1\. How would you design a URL shortening service like TinyURL?**

*   **Answer**: Use a distributed key-value store (e.g., Redis) to map short URLs to long URLs. Generate unique short codes using hashing or base62 encoding.
    

### **2\. How would you design a rate-limiting system?**

*   **Answer**: Use a sliding window algorithm with Redis to track request counts per user/IP. Reject requests that exceed the limit.
    

### **3\. How would you design a distributed cache?**

*   **Answer**: Use consistent hashing to distribute data across multiple cache servers. Implement cache eviction policies like LRU (Least Recently Used).
    

### **4\. How would you design a notification system?**

*   **Answer**: Use a message queue (e.g., Kafka) to handle notifications asynchronously. Store notifications in a database and deliver them via email, SMS, or push notifications.
    

### **5\. How would you design a search autocomplete system?**

*   **Answer**: Use a Trie data structure to store search terms. Cache popular queries in Redis for faster retrieval.
    

**Scalability Questions**
-------------------------

### **6\. What is horizontal scaling?**

*   **Answer**: Horizontal scaling involves adding more machines to a system to handle increased load. It is commonly used in distributed systems.
    

### **7\. What is vertical scaling?**

*   **Answer**: Vertical scaling involves adding more resources (e.g., CPU, RAM) to an existing machine. It is limited by the hardware capacity.
    

### **8\. What is database sharding?**

*   **Answer**: Sharding is the process of splitting a database into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards. Each shard is stored on a separate database server.
    

### **9\. What is database replication?**

*   **Answer**: Database replication is the process of copying data from one database server to another to ensure redundancy and high availability.
    

### **10\. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous replication?**

*   **Answer**:
    
    *   **Synchronous Replication**: Data is written to the primary and replica simultaneously. Ensures strong consistency but may introduce latency.
        
    *   **Asynchronous Replication**: Data is written to the replica after the primary. Improves performance but may lead to data loss in case of failure.
        

**Advanced Database Questions**
-------------------------------

### **11\. What is a deadlock in databases?**

*   **Answer**: A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release locks, causing a standstill. It can be resolved by using timeouts or deadlock detection algorithms.
    

### **12\. What is a covering index?**

*   **Answer**: A covering index is an index that includes all the columns needed to satisfy a query, eliminating the need to access the table.
    

### **13\. What is a materialized view?**

*   **Answer**: A materialized view is a database object that stores the result of a query. It is used to improve query performance by precomputing expensive operations.
    

### **14\. What is the difference between a primary key and a unique key?**

*   **Answer**:
    
    *   **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies a row in a table and cannot beÂ NULL.
        
    *   **Unique Key**: Ensures that all values in a column are unique but can containÂ NULL.
        

### **15\. What is a composite key?**

*   **Answer**: A composite key is a combination of two or more columns that uniquely identify a row in a table.
    

**Security Questions**

*   **Answer**: A security token is a piece of data used to authenticate a user or request. Examples includeÂ **JWT**Â (JSON Web Tokens) andÂ **OAuth tokens**.
    

### **17\. What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?**

*   **Answer**:
    
    *   **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).
        
    *   **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption (e.g., RSA).
        

### **18\. What is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack?**

*   **Answer**: A MITM attack occurs when an attacker intercepts and alters communication between two parties without their knowledge. Prevention methods include using HTTPS and certificate pinning.
    

### **19\. What is certificate pinning?**

*   **Answer**: Certificate pinning is a security mechanism where a client only accepts a specific SSL/TLS certificate for a domain. It prevents MITM attacks by rejecting fraudulent certificates.

**Advanced Topics**
-------------------

### **36\. What is the CAP theorem?**

*   **Answer**: The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only guarantee two out of the following three properties:
