# ðŸš€ 50 Backend Interview Questions with Detailed Answers

Here's a comprehensive list of 50 backend interview questions with detailed and advanced answers to help you prepare for your next backend development interview.

## Node.js Questions

1. **What is Node.js?**  
   Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine and is designed for building scalable network applications. Node.js is event-driven and non-blocking, making it ideal for real-time applications.

2. **What is the event loop in Node.js?**  
   The event loop is a mechanism that allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations. It continuously checks the call stack and processes events from the event queue. The event loop consists of several phases, such as timers, I/O callbacks, idle/prepare, poll, check, and close callbacks.

3. **What is the difference between require and import?**  
   - `require` is used in CommonJS (Node.js default), while `import` is used in ES6 modules.
   - `require` is dynamic and can be used anywhere in the code, while `import` is static and must be used at the top of the file.
   - `import` supports tree-shaking (removing unused code), while `require` does not.

4. **How does Node.js handle child threads?**  
   Node.js is single-threaded but uses the `worker_threads` module to create child threads for CPU-intensive tasks. Each worker thread runs in isolation and communicates with the main thread via message passing.

5. **What is the purpose of the package.json file?**  
   The `package.json` file contains metadata about the project, including:
   - Dependencies and devDependencies.
   - Scripts for running tasks (e.g., `npm start`).
   - Project configuration (e.g., name, version, license).

## Express.js Questions

6. **What is Express.js?**  
   Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of APIs and web servers. It provides features like routing, middleware support, and template engines.

7. **What is middleware in Express.js?**  
   Middleware is a function that has access to the request (`req`), response (`res`), and the next middleware in the application's request-response cycle. Middleware can:
   - Execute code.
   - Modify `req` and `res` objects.
   - End the request-response cycle.
   - Call the next middleware.

8. **How do you handle errors in Express.js?**  
   Errors can be handled using a special middleware function with four arguments: `(err, req, res, next)`. Example:
   ```javascript
   app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
     console.error(err.stack);
     res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
   });
   ```

9. **What is the purpose of app.use() in Express.js?**  
   `app.use()` is used to mount middleware functions at a specified path. It can be used for:
   - Logging.
   - Authentication.
   - Parsing request bodies.

10. **How do you serve static files in Express.js?**  
    Use `express.static()` middleware to serve static files from a directory. Example:
    ```javascript
    app.use(express.static('public'));
    ```

## Database Questions

11. **What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?**  
    - **SQL**: Relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). Data is stored in tables with predefined schemas. Supports complex queries and transactions.
    - **NoSQL**: Non-relational databases (e.g., MongoDB, Redis). Data is stored in collections/documents. Flexible and scalable for unstructured data.

12. **What is indexing in databases?**  
    Indexing is a technique to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It creates a data structure (e.g., B-tree) to quickly locate rows.

13. **What is a transaction in databases?**  
    A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. It ensures data integrity by following the **ACID** properties:
    - **Atomicity**: All operations succeed or fail together.
    - **Consistency**: Data remains consistent before and after the transaction.
    - **Isolation**: Transactions are isolated from each other.
    - **Durability**: Once committed, changes are permanent.

14. **What is normalization in databases?**  
    Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them.

15. **What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?**  
    - **INNER JOIN**: Returns only matching rows from both tables.
    - **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If no match is found, `NULL` is returned for the right table.

## Advanced Questions

16. **What is the CAP theorem?**  
    The CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only guarantee two out of the following three properties:
    - **Consistency**: Every read receives the most recent write.
    - **Availability**: Every request receives a response.
    - **Partition Tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite network partitions.

17. **What is eventual consistency?**  
    Eventual consistency is a model where updates to a distributed system are propagated asynchronously. The system will eventually become consistent, but there may be a delay.

18. **What is a distributed lock?**  
    A distributed lock is a mechanism to ensure that only one process can access a resource at a time in a distributed system. Tools like Redis or ZooKeeper can be used to implement distributed locks.

19. **What is a message queue?**  
    A message queue is a system that allows applications to communicate asynchronously by sending and receiving messages. Examples include RabbitMQ and Kafka.

20. **What is the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling?**  
    - **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more machines to a system to handle increased load.
    - **Vertical Scaling**: Adding more resources (e.g., CPU, RAM) to an existing machine.
