# Backend Development Assignments for Interview Preparation

Here are **20 assignments** designed to help you prepare for backend development interviews. These assignments cover a wide range of topics, from basic to advanced, and are commonly asked in technical interviews.

## **Core Concepts**

### **1. RESTful API Design**
- Design a RESTful API for a blog application with endpoints for:
  - Creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts.
  - Adding and retrieving comments for a blog post.
- Use proper HTTP methods and status codes.
- **Skills Tested**: REST API design, routing, and CRUD operations.

---

### **2. Authentication and Authorization**
- Implement JWT-based authentication for a user management system.
- Include endpoints for:
  - User registration and login.
  - Accessing protected routes (e.g., user profile) using JWT.
- **Skills Tested**: JWT, authentication, and authorization.

---

### **3. Pagination and Filtering**
- Build an API that returns paginated and filtered data (e.g., a list of products).
- Use query parameters like `page`, `limit`, and `category` for filtering.
- Example: `/products?page=1&limit=10&category=electronics`.
- **Skills Tested**: Pagination, filtering, and query parameter handling.

---

### **4. Error Handling**
- Enhance an existing API to handle errors gracefully.
  - Return 404 for invalid routes.
  - Return 400 for bad requests (e.g., missing fields).
  - Return 500 for server errors.
- **Skills Tested**: Error handling middleware and HTTP status codes.

---

### **5. File Upload and Download**
- Create an API that allows users to upload and download files (e.g., images or documents).
- Use `Multer` for file uploads and `res.download()` for file downloads.
- **Skills Tested**: File handling and middleware usage.

---

## **Database Integration**

### **6. CRUD with MongoDB**
- Build a CRUD API for a task management system using MongoDB.
- Use Mongoose as the ODM.
- **Skills Tested**: MongoDB, Mongoose, and CRUD operations.

---

### **7. SQL Database Integration**
- Create a CRUD API for a user management system using MySQL or PostgreSQL.
- Use an ORM like Sequelize.
- **Skills Tested**: SQL, ORM usage, and database integration.

---

### **8. Database Indexing**
- Optimize a database query by adding indexes to frequently queried fields.
- Demonstrate the performance improvement using `explain()` in MongoDB or `EXPLAIN` in SQL.
- **Skills Tested**: Database optimization and indexing.

---

### **9. Transactions**
- Implement a banking system API where users can transfer money between accounts.
- Use database transactions to ensure atomicity.
- **Skills Tested**: Transactions and data consistency.

---

### **10. Database Migrations**
- Use a migration tool like `Knex.js` or `Sequelize Migrations` to manage database schema changes.
- Demonstrate adding a new column to an existing table.
- **Skills Tested**: Database migrations and schema management.

---

## **Advanced Concepts**

### **11. Rate Limiting**
- Implement rate limiting for an API to prevent abuse.
- Use `express-rate-limit` middleware to limit requests to 100 per hour per IP.
- **Skills Tested**: Rate limiting and middleware usage.

---

### **12. Caching with Redis**
- Integrate Redis to cache API responses (e.g., product listings).
- Demonstrate the performance improvement.
- **Skills Tested**: Redis integration and caching strategies.

---

### **13. WebSocket Integration**
- Build a real-time chat application using `socket.io`.
- Allow users to send and receive messages in real-time.
- **Skills Tested**: WebSocket integration and real-time communication.

---

### **14. Unit Testing**
- Write unit tests for your API endpoints using `Jest` or `Mocha`.
- Test all CRUD operations and edge cases.
- **Skills Tested**: Unit testing and test-driven development (TDD).

---

### **15. Load Balancing**
- Deploy your application on multiple servers and use a load balancer (e.g., Nginx) to distribute traffic.
- Demonstrate horizontal scaling.
- **Skills Tested**: Load balancing and deployment.

---

## **System Design**

### **16. URL Shortener**
- Design and implement a URL shortener service.
- Generate short URLs and redirect users to the original URL.
- **Skills Tested**: System design, hashing, and routing.

---

### **17. E-commerce Cart System**
- Build an API for an e-commerce cart system.
- Include endpoints for:
  - Adding/removing items from the cart.
  - Calculating the total price.
- **Skills Tested**: System design and business logic implementation.

---

### **18. Job Queue with Bull**
- Implement a job queue system using `Bull` and Redis.
- Simulate sending emails as background jobs.
- **Skills Tested**: Job queues and background processing.

---

### **19. API Gateway**
- Create an API gateway that routes requests to multiple microservices.
- Implement authentication and logging at the gateway level.
- **Skills Tested**: API gateway design and microservices.

---

### **20. Dockerize Your Application**
- Dockerize your Node.js and Express application.
- Use Docker Compose to run your app with a database (e.g., MongoDB).
- **Skills Tested**: Docker, containerization, and deployment.

---

## **Bonus Tips**
- Use **Postman** to test your APIs.
- Write clean and modular code (e.g., separate routes, controllers, and models).
- Use **Git** to version control your projects.
- Document your APIs using tools like **Swagger** or **Postman**.
